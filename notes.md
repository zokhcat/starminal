notes
 - ra / dec === lat and long for stars
 - *sidereal time*(GMST) would say which celestial sphere is aligned to my current location's meridian

```
1: Compute Julian Date from UTC time
2: Compute GMST (Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time)
  GMST = 280.46061837 + 360.98564736629 × (JD − 2451545.0) + ...
3: Adjust for your longitude
  LST = GMST + (your_longitude / 15)
  LST = GMST + 5.34 hours

```
- if *LST = 6h* that means the *celestial sphere with RA = 6h* is on my meridian
- Hour Angle (HA) signifies where the star is from my meridian, if HA = 0 then it suggests that it is
  located in my meridian.

Viewing Window:
What will I see from meridian. Viewing Window is generated. if alt<0, we are not rendering that one. We require a map of (alt, az) co-ordinates that will be render in a canvas/sky.

```
Inputs:
  HA  = hour angle (radians)
  dec = star's declination (radians)
  lat = your latitude (radians)

Formula:
  sin(alt) = sin(dec) × sin(lat) + cos(dec) × cos(lat) × cos(HA)
  alt = arcsin(result)

  cos(az) = [sin(dec) − sin(alt) × sin(lat)] / [cos(alt) × cos(lat)]
  az = arccos(result)
  if sin(HA) > 0: az = 360° − az
```
